Y6-I5BHsEck,Economics Explained,Why Bangladesh Won't Be The Next China,"Thanks to Opera for sponsoring this video. Click here https://opr.as/vhcp-Economics-Explained to upgrade your browser for FREE!

Bangladesh has a troubled past, but it has been in a great position to grow dramatically in much the same way that its neighbour China has done in the recent past. Bangladesh is still a highly labour intensive market which makes it a great place to get T-shirts made, but a number of factors have made it painfully slow to develop beyond that. Could Bangladesh change things to become the next China?

The EU, a unique economic giant, acts similarly to the US federal government, hinting at a ""United States of Europe"" with its shared currency, policies, and trade deals among 27 states. Despite its near-federal structure, it lacks some federation benefits, posing issues for its members. With a $20 trillion output, second only to the USA, it wields significant global influence. However, its major economies face stagnant growth, mirroring challenges for smaller members.

Oil and GDP are closely linked together, with the more oil consumed by a country generally meaning the higher the GDP of that country. With that said, energy costs of solar, wind and other technologies have come down substantially in recent decades meaning that ""clean"" solar power is actually one of the cheapest ways to generate electricity over its lifespan. So why haven't we switched completely over to solar? Well, it's not that easy.

""Made in Germany"" carries with ti a kind of prestige, and a marker of quality. Germany is famous for it's incredible engineering and manufacturing talent, but more and more this is becoming a thing of the past as overseas manufacturers start to build up their centres, and can produce on a scale that Germany just can't keep up with. Is this crisis going to end German manufacturing?

Africa is the poorest continent in the world. There are, as always, a lot of factors to consider as to why that is the case, but recently Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson from MIT have released a study detailing the surprising bigger factors in why Africa still struggles to build wealth despite massive amounts of incoming aid and charity work trying to improve the lives of people there. So what are the reasons why much of Africa can't seem to get out of poverty?

Canada has gone through a lot in the last 10 years, and one of the biggest problems is the price of housing. Canadian cities are in such a small area of the country's landmass and housing construction has not kept up with the population, so housing prices have skyrocketed. Canada now finds itself in a bit of a population trap, where they can't afford to keep bringing in more people and put even more strain on housing, but they also can't afford not to.

We've talked about some incredibly poor countries on this channel before, but perhaps nothing as bad as the small East African country of Eritrea. This country is a complete military dictatorship, and has been called the North Korea of Africa. There are no free markets. No trading partners. Their debt to GDP ratio runs very high for one reason only: their country is in a critical region of the world for international shipping. But life really couldn't be much worse in Eritrea.

Capitalism is the system that has helped the world become infinitely more wealthy than it has ever been in human history, but there are problems. A disregard for the drawbacks of production like waste, pollution and inequality are often cited by people who want capitalism to be replaced by social democracy, communism or even anarchy. But even communist countries like the USSR and China have reluctantly returned to capitalism. So, is capitalism inevitable?

France's problems arguably go back 200 years to their slow and steady approach to adopting industrialisation. While many other countries can learn from France's strong protection for workers' rights, at the moment this has made France a very uncompetitive country with some of the worst brain drain across the EU. Why work in France for lower wages when they can make so much more in the UK, Germany and the US. Is France stuck at just being the place with fancy handbags and perfumes, or can it change it's economy to stay internationally competitive?

Apparently us guys think about the Roman Empire 5 times a day, but from an economic Perspective it's hard to see why. While they did build a lot of architectural monuments, their economy was actually rather pathetic by almost all metrics. Why was Rome, which had a large empire and notoriety throughout Europe for millennia after its demise, actually a very weak economy?

There is no more deadly area in the world than the DMZ between North and South Korea. Millions of mines, and lots of guns and surveillance prevent anyone from crossing. But if tensions were to somehow stop and North and South Korea reunite into one country, it would still be almost impossible to combine their economies. Why would we not be able to use the lessons learned by the reunification of East and West Germany?

Japan's economy has been stagnant for 2 decades, and while some economists look at this as an outlier, it might be something that just happens to all advanced economies, and Japan just got there first. After suffering the ""lost generation"", can Japan come back and recover growth, or is their fate one we will all eventually reach?

Australia's biggest export is natural resources, and as we have talked about on the channel many times, this isn't always a great thing for an economy. Resources don't provide much value to the local economy, especially in Australia where mines are thousands of miles from residential centres, and they don't employ all that many people for the massive wealth they create. Australia lags far behind technological centres like the US, but somehow has a strong economy. How has it done this and what can we learn from a country that just digs holes and builds homes?

Greece became infamous for their economic stagnation following adoption of the Euro and subsequent over-spending and debt accumulation. But in recent years their economy has been improving and, while it isn't out of the woods yet, there have definitely been big improvements that are worth celebrating. Are they still broke, or will Greece's economy be an example to others how to recover from financial meltdown?

With billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos setting their sights on space exploration and development, there must be some commercially viable industries in space and on Mars, right? Well, it's a little more complicated than just mining the asteroids that contain trillions of dollars of value, or building heavy things in micro-gravity, and certainly a base on Mars might cost more than it's worth. Making Mars a viable economy might not even be possible.

Sometimes as economists we need to analyse complex decisions to understand what the outcomes might be. On the more baffling end of the scale we have Saudi Arabia spending billions on football, golf and Formula 1 stars who are mostly a little past their prime to come and play in the largely unknown Saudi leagues. Is this simply sports-washing (a PR stunt) or is there something more clever going on?

Singapore, once a poor nation, rose to the 33rd largest economy in 50 years, inspiring other countries globally. Yet, its unique journey, often misunderstood to be solely based on glamorous industries, is not easy to replicate, and many economists forget the draconian measures it took to build Singapore into the wealthy country it is today.

Unfortunately for theoretical economists, we are not allowed to run economics experiments on the whole of society to see definitively whether or not certain economic policies or systems work in practice. Millions of lives hang in the balance, so this is an ethical non-starter. But we can study countries that have experimented with socialism, communism, and laissez faire capitalism to see what the outcomes are. And the experiments have been done.

It might sound absurd, but some economists are talking about the possibility of the US defaulting on its debts, closing off to global trade and using its own domestic industries and energy production to save its economy, which currently is tipping further and further into unsustainable national debt (Fitch just downgraded the US credit rating from AAA to AA+).

Trade wars are costing the world trillions of dollars every year, but far less attention is paid to the movement and control of the movement of skills and labour. It is much easier than ever before to take an education and move to a country where workers can benefit personally, but at a certain cost to the country that trained them. Skills wars may be the new trade wars.

Check out Part 2 on our Patreon - Indonesia's Banking Problem
➡️ https://www.patreon.com/EconomicsExplained

Indonesia's economy has been growing rapidly, and thanks to a younger population it could be on track to become one of the biggest economies in the world. There are a few things holding Indonesia back, such as Jakarta sinking into the ocean, but with their natural resource wealth and access to the world's oceans, it could become a huge player in making the goods we all use every day.

When people think of Taiwan, they mostly think of tensions with China and the fact that Taiwan is a major manufacturing centre for the world's semiconductors. But Taiwan's leaders actually made some big bets decades ago that are paying off now, with a GDP per capita roughly 3 times that of mainland China.

As machines and sophisticated technologies surpass human abilities, a growing number of complex jobs are being outsourced to machines who can do better work for a lower cost. This prompts questions about how economic systems can adapt to most people having a net negative economic value.

In this video we wanted to highlight the paradox of global economic growth alongside isolated national crises. Why do certain economies like Lebanon, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan face collapse when the global economy is reaching unprecedented highs? We'll identify common factors behind these failures, and discuss potential solutions to safeguard other nations from similar fates.

We're exploring South Korea's impressive economic transformation, from an agrarian backwater to a global powerhouse. Home to internationally recognized companies and cutting-edge industries, South Korea is a fascinating case study for economists worldwide. In this video, we'll examine the drivers of South Korea's potential growth in the next decade, the obstacles that could undermine its entire economic system, and why this is all so important for the rest of us outside South Korea for our own economies. Then we'll rank South Korea on the Economics Explained National Leaderboard.

In this video we will rank the European Union (EU) as if it were a country on the Economics Explained National Leaderboard, after exploring the economic challenges and opportunities facing all current member states. The EU collectively represents the third largest economy in the world, after China and the USA, with a population of 447 million people and 20 member countries that use the Euro, the second most widely held reserve currency after the USD. The five biggest countries in the EU by population are Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Poland, and the region has a significant impact on the global economy. However, the EU faces several significant economic challenges, including the debt crisis, Brexit, and tensions with major energy suppliers. We will also examine the potential impact of a non-unified Europe on the global economy and the likelihood of other nations following the UK's example and leaving the union. By exploring these issues, viewers can gain insights into the workings of economic unions and the potential future of the EU.

The video describes the recent banking crisis in Silicon Valley, where three banks including Silicon Valley Bank failed, causing bank runs and putting pressure on other banks like Credit Suisse. This is reminiscent of past US banking disasters such as the Great Depression and the 2008 recession. Many economists predict that more banks around the world will face similar pressures, and the video raises important questions about the causes and potential consequences of these failures.

They are now running a massive Valentine’s Day Sale, plus 10% off on any purchase with code ECONOMICS. Thanks to Established Titles for sponsoring this video!

Established Titles is a fun novelty gift, meant for a good laugh and not to be taken too seriously. Established Titles bought a couple hundred acres of land in Scotland, and have pledged to protect it and keep it as is forever, and they donate to plant a tree for every order through Trees for the Future. The title packs do not grant the titleholder peerage or a right to rule, but are based on a historic Scottish custom, where landowners have been long referred to as “Lairds”, the Scottish term for “Lord”, with the female equivalent being “Lady”.

Over the past 2 decades Sri Lanka was one of the fastest growing economies in Asia thanks to its tourism industry and relatively educated workforce. To further bolster growth the government borrowed huge amounts of money at high interest rates. This eventually culminated with a debt crisis in 2022 which led to a near-total collapse in the economy.

Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and other oil rich Middle Eastern states have announced plans to collectively invest trillions of dollars in new megaprojects, the most extreme of which is Saudi Arabia's $1 trillion 170km skyscraper called The Line. Why are these countries spending so much on mega projects and does it make any economic sense?

Up until 1990 India was slightly richer than China on a per capita basis, but since then China's economy has grown far faster than India's. In this video we look at the structural issues in India's economy have thus far prevented it from achieving the same level of economic success as China.

In this video we go over the pros and cons of a universal basic income. The US government spent over $5 trillion of economic stimulus and relief payments during the pandemic of 2020 and 2021. This is enough money to give every adult in the country $1,000 per month during this 2 year period. Would the money have been better spent just giving it directly to the people?

Nyan Cat, a video of LeBron James dunking, and a tweet by Jack Dorsey. These all have one thing in common (and no, it’s not because they were sold in recent months for millions of dollars, contrary to what you may have heard).

What actually happened was the unique digital signatures of these three pieces of media were sold-off to a new breed of 21st-century collectors; bringing massive attention to these Non-Fungible Tokens (or NFTs).
 
Overwhelmingly, the astronomical prices some NFT sales have fetched have attracted ridicule by outside observers. Perhaps understandably so, considering some are spending Lamborghini money on a Nyan Pop-Tart cat GIF that you anyone watch for free online.

But is it really all that ridiculous?

In this video, we’ll explore the potential NFTs hold and why these laughable prices may not be so absurd after all.

$42 billion dollars.

That is the amount of money grossed by films at the global box office in 2019.

Impressive? Definitely. Surprising? Probably not, especially when you consider that global box office revenues have increased year-over-year since 2005.

That was, of course, until COVID.

As you’d expect, the pandemic has devastated Hollywood – resulting in an unprecedented seventy-one percent (71%) decline in global box office revenue.

Worse yet, we all have to go another year without Daniel Craig’s No Time To Die – 
a title that has since taken-on somewhat of an eerie meaning.

But putting the absence of James Bond aside ... movie ticket sales have actually been on the decline for nearly two decades – despite a steady increase in population over the same period.

So, if people are going to movie theatres less often – and they are –
then what exactly is driving the growth behind global box office revenue? [note]

To answer this question, you have to understand the economics of Hollywood.

 How do movies get funded?

 What is the role of government subsidies and alternative revenue sources?

 How can a movie gross more than its budget and still lose money?

And finally, what are the economics behind movie theatres and their twenty-dollar buckets of popcorn?

This is New Zealand – a picturesque nation with an economy that appears to exclusively rely on throwing tourists off cliffs in increasingly imaginative ways.

But Australia’s ""little brother"" is not to be underestimated. In fact, New Zealand is, arguably, the world’s best-managed economy. After considering the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index and various high-ranking Quality of Life and Happiness assessments, it's little wonder as to why consistently ranks New Zealand at the top (move aside, Norway!).

Perhaps even more remarkable is that this tiny island country has achieved remarkable prosperity in spite of not having notable natural resources (or acting as a tax haven for global businesses).

What are the primary drivers of New Zealand's economic prosperity?

How has the nation been able to accommodate these where other nations fail to do so?

And what are the challenges the nation might face to keep this success going?

... All this and more in today's episode of Economics Explained!

So the holidays are behind us and if you were left disappointed by what you found under your Christmas tree it might be because you weren’t in the spirit of things, or it might have been because Santa couldn’t get any stock of anything. 

The good little consumers of the world might have started to notice an increasingly common trend where more and more products sell out the day they are released, or are never available at all to ordinary consumers. 

Everything from playstations, switches, Xboxes and graphics cards, to lego sets, handbags, watches, and even toilet paper, it seems more and more like we are living in a world that is out of stock.

But why?

Stock shortages from time to time happen, that’s just general supply chain management but why has this become such a consistent issue. 

All of these products are made by businesses with a profit motive, and those profits don’t get made unless products get sold, so what gives?

Now I know what you might be thinking, “urr it’s the virus of course” and certainly this has thrown a spanner into the works of global supply chains but it’s not the whole story. 

Limited supply is one thing, but if traditional economics is to be believed, businesses don’t let themselves run out of stock, instead they just raise prices to match demand and maximise their profits. 

What’s more, is that the coronavirus is not exactly new news to companies. If they were caught out in early 2020 then fair enough, but almost a year later you would think the corporate executives responsible for multi-billion dollar product launches could account for this new global paradigm, right?

But they haven’t, and you might ask why?

Well to understand this we as always need to look at a few key things. 

How have global supply chains been affected, beyond just blaming everything on covid?

Are the companies involved actually making poor business decisions?

And why aren’t these products just doing what supply and demand would tell them to do and increase in price?

0:00 - 2:27 Poverty in China
2:28 - 4:37 Measuring poverty
4:38 - 6:53 Globalization
6:54 - 8:49 Government's goals
8:50 Cow program

Whenever we see china in the news it’s normally for some impressive statistic about building stuff, or how it is now home to the most millionaires in the world, or maybe it’s even an article about whatever geopolitical tomfoolery they are trying to pull this week. 

But what is often forgotten about this is that behind the somewhat intimidating outward appearance of economic might and glistening skyscrapers, china is an extremely poor country. 

This almost sounds a bit paradoxical given the wealth that is so evident from the outside. Never the less average incomes in China are still less than $15,000 USD’s per year, and that’s average, so in a nation that reports a Gini coefficient of 0.47 with some independent research noting this could be as high as 0.73 that means there are a lot of poor people at home in this economic miracle. 

In plain English, this means upwards of half a billion people in China are living on less than $10 per day, primarily made up of those still living in rural areas.

Now this fact is not lost on the Chinese government, who know that a growing wealth divide in their worker’s paradise is not a great look, especially if that divide is between the cities fueling growth and the farmers feeding them. 

That is why in just the last 5 years the government has poured the equivalent of over 800 billion dollars into aid in area’s where extreme poverty is still commonplace. This is to say nothing on state-owned enterprises which easily bring this running total to over a trillion dollars in the same time period. 

A trillion dollars in 5 years, that’s more than the entire GDP of 3 quarters of the world’s countries, on one single welfare project. 

Even for a government as wealthy as China’s, this is ultimately not sustainable.

So a new solution was needed to make these systems more efficient at solving core issues rather than alleviating the symptoms with handfuls of cash.

And there might be a lot to take away from what they have done so as always we need to understand a few things. 

How much poverty is there actually left in china?

Why is this so difficult to measure?

Why does China care so much?

And how might cows be the solution to this whole problem?

This is Argentina, a South American nation which has been home to an unprecedented period of sustained growth quintupling in size in the last decade. 

This nation has seen remarkable resilience through financial crises and even though it cycled through 5 presidents in two weeks, its continued re-investment in itself has paid off many times over as average incomes have doubled in the same time period to create fantastic increases in the quality of life for all the citizens of the nation. 

Or at least that would have been the video we were making a few years ago. 

Unfortunately today the economy of Argentina tells a very different story.

Just as quickly as the economy soared to these lofty heights it has crashed back down bringing about a period of heavy inflation and widespread poverty. 

But perhaps this shouldn’t be a huge surprise, in the last 100 years the economy of Argentina has been categorized by periods of massive growth followed by huge declines making the most recent decades little more than a continuation of that unfortunate trend.

This is a real shame because Argentina obviously has a lot going for it, from a healthy population of productive workers, strong natural resource reserves and even a landmass that is very conducive to foundational industries like manufacturing and agriculture. 

But despite all of these advantages Argentina has time and time again fallen into this unfortunate pattern, and is now teetering on the edge of becoming a full-blown failed state. 

Nobel prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets is said to have remarked in the early 1970’s that there are four types of economies in the world, developed, underdeveloped, Japan and Argentina. 

We have already explored what makes Japan so weird, but to unravel the mystery of Argentina we are going to have to understand a few specific issues. 

What has caused the various economic booms over the years?

What has caused the subsequent economic declines? 

And why is this most recent downturn just a little bit different? 

Once we have done all of that we can get to the fun stuff and put Argentina on the economics explained national leaderboard, hows that for a 2020 grand final.

This is 2020, and as I am sure most of you are aware it will soon be coming to an end.

The end of a year, especially one as trying as this is always a good time to reflect and get yourself ready for the next trip around the sun. 

And what better way to look back, then to focus on every little mistake that the comment section so kindly pointed out for you. That’s gotta build up that holiday cheer.

But in all seriousness, it is always important to highlight areas where things can be improved, explained better or corrected especially in a situation where so many people tune in twice a week to listen to mr economics man talk about whatever it is he decides is interesting. 

So welcome to all of the mistakes that Economics Explained made in the year 2020. 

We will be breaking this video down into 3 main categories. 

Minor issues, caused by simple human error.

Issues that could potentially cause confusion

And yes even a few major issues that do need to be corrected so that we may sleep at night knowing all of our wonderful viewers are learning all of the right things.

lwYOJLGw-Mw,Economics Explained,Why Would Amazon Want to Buy The Nation of Cyprus? & Could it Actually Do It? | Economics Explained,"Sign-up for Acorns! 👉 https://acorns.com/ee?s2=CYPR3 (upon registration, Acorns will deposit $5 in your account to help you get started with investing!)

This is Cyprus, an absolutely gorgeous nation in the Mediterranian filled with beautiful little towns a laid-back way of life and an economy that is supposedly for sale. 

That’s right, a fair few of you watching may have seen headlines that apparently Amazon is going to purchase the island nation and set up its global headquarters there to have its very own little tax haven. 

This story was originally published by Saxo Bank which is a small European investment bank with a lot of operations in the area. 

Now spoiler alert, it’s not going to happen, but it’s not as crazy as it sounds and one day it genuinely could make sense as a sound business plan. So stick around, partially because I need that average watch time so that the youtube algorithm may bless this video, but mostly because this bizarre prediction can tell us a lot about possibly the weirdest economy in the world.

There is a very good reason that Cyprus was singled out as the most likely country to be purchased in the 2020 national yearbook and that is because of its long history of hmmm let’s say being very agreeable to the whim of institutions with a healthy bankroll. 

But of course, the nation is fascinating for so many more reasons not least of which is that half of the country is technically subject to an illegal occupation of the territory of the EU.

And it gets even weirder than that, if you were to look at the island of Cyprus you would be forgiven for thinking it is just one little ol country, but depending on who you ask it has as many as 4 different entities claiming sovereignty over what is a very beautiful but otherwise very barren piece of land. 

So there is a lot going on here and as always the best way to make sense of a lot of this is to look at the economics of the island to work out what is truly motivating all of these powerful institutions that apparently want to own Cyprus. 

So
 
What is really driving the economy of Cyprus?

Why are so many people laying claim to it?

How have these tensions come back to bit them in recent years?

Why would it make the ideal country for some global megacorporation like amazon to buy?

And of course, once we have made sense of all of that, we can go ahead and put Cyprus on the economics explained national leaderboard.

This is night city, the futuristic metropolis which is home to most of the action taking place in cyberpunk 2077, which has quickly become the most popular PC benchmarking software in 2020. 

There are a few reasons I wanted to explore the economy of this fictional world, for starters I gotta cash in on a subject that’s at the top of Google Trends, It’s been a while since I have done a virtual economy, I need a way to class my new gaming PC as a business expense and of course it actually genuinely very interesting. 

Part of the appeal of this game was the way it wove an alternative reality in with themes and events that are taking place in our modern world to build an economy that both feels abstract but also entirely possible. 

That virtual economy then builds the framework of an immersive world that is equally realistic and fanciful. 

The world of cyberpunk 2077 is a cautionary dystopian tale that takes modern economic issues, like wealth inequality, corporate influence, white-collar corruption, militarisation, black market dealings and environmental degradation, and then turns those headlines up to to a whole new level to let people experience making their way through a world where these problems go unchecked. 

It also goes without saying that this game has made headlines for a host of technical issues that have perhaps continued the theme of shining a light on economic problems in the real world. 

So the economics of cyberpunk 2077 is a great case study for lots of weird and wonderful economic happenings. 

How did the economy of this virtual world get to where it is in the year 2077.

What are the key components of Night City’s economy?

And a bit of a tangent

What business decisions led to the chaos surrounding the game’s launch.

Oh and cyberpunk 2077 technically takes part in an independent city-state so you know what the hey, may as well throw it on the economics explained national leaderboard. 

Oh but first A little disclaimer, this video will not have any spoilers relevant to the plot, so don’t worry for all of you that haven’t been able to play the game yet (which is basically everybody).

This is Ireland, or more specifically the Republic of Ireland which is a sovereign nation that is home to 5 million people who are all quickly becoming some of the wealthiest citizens in the world. 

Ireland now has a GDP per capita of over $90,000 meaning they are well ahead of traditionally wealthy nationals or regions like Switzerland, Hong Kong and Norway and only placing behind statistical outliers like Luxembourg, Singapore and Qatar. 

What’s more, is that Ireland is on track to be the fastest-growing economy in 2020 a year that has seen most nations fall behind. 

It has achieved this despite historically being very dependent on trade and tourism which has of course been a lot more difficult in a world of closed borders. 

So it looks like there should be a lot to learn from this country that could potentially be adapted to our own economies so that we too may share in the luck of the Irish right?

Well, that’s what the figures might have you believe but it may not be the whole story. 

Frequent viewers of the channel will know that GDP figures alone can leave out some very important details about the true prosperity of a nation and the people living within it. 

So to see if Ireland is more than a miracle of paperwork we need to look at a few key areas.

How has Ireland become so wealthy despite it’s history of being poor and oppressed?

Is this wealth going to benefit the citizens of the nation?

And is this Irish strategy something that all nations could adopt?

Oh and while we are here it should go without saying that we are going to put Ireland on the Economics Explained national leaderboard.

This is bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager of Pershing square capital. 

Bill has been featured on this channel a few times before, most notably because of his trade made in early 2020 which netted him over 2.6 billion dollars in profit. 

Since then he has become a bit of an internet darling which is just great for him because a lot of his trading strategies require him winning over hearts and minds to change people’s opinions on a stock, bond, cryptocurrency or whatever else it is that he has some kind of vested interest in. 

Now this is nothing new, influential stock traders have been trying to create news stories that suit them ever since there were stock markets and newspapers.

But this most recent announcement has been a little bit different. 

Ackman along with a selection of business leaders and economists have started advocating for a plan that would give everybody a few thousand dollars in cash on the day they are borns all in order to solve the retirement crisis. 

It sounds crazy, but there may be more merit to this whole plan than you think.

Most advanced economies around the world today are dealing with aging populations and declining birth rates. A future where the dependent elderly far outweigh the productive young is fast approaching, current pension infrastructure may just not be able to cope. 

We may see a future where the quality of life for elderly citizens rapidly declines, or young people are taxed very heavily in order to support them, neither of which sounds particularly appealing to anyone, so perhaps radical solutions are what we need. 

And to understand this plan we are going to need to look at a few key areas. 

How would handing out money to babies solve problems amongst the elderly?

How would nations afford this?

And is this actually a sound idea? Or just another scheme by a savvy businessman to profit off front-page news.

So apparently we are due for a fourth industrial revolution, which might come as a surprise to you because as far as most people can tell we have only had one industrial revolution, and some nations haven’t even got around to that one yet. 

All the same, this promise of a radical shift in the way we live our lives has got a lot of economists very excited and maybe a little bit anxious, both for very good reasons. 

The first industrial revolution, you know the one that we all think is the only industrial revolution was responsible for giving us production. 

This production went on to define our way of life in the modern world where people in advanced economies have access to practically unlimited food, robust housing, and bits and bobs to fulfill our every little desire. 

The world before this was very stagnant. The idea that we have economic growth at all, where society is always advancing and every generation is richer than the one that came before it is a surprisingly modern ideology. 

What’s more, is that it’s not something that we are guaranteed. We can only get so good at making stuff given our current set of technologies and resources, and in fact, we might already be starting to see this plateau. 

Arguably the rollout of smartphones that gave us unlimited access to information wherever we were, was the last great paradigm shift in how we lived our lives.

13 years later this technology is improving but it doesn’t offer anything fundamentally different to the way that we live our lives, run our economies or advance our standard of living. 

But maybe we are getting ahead of ourselves.

To really know what to expect from this supposedly incipient fourth revolution we must first understand a few key things.

How do economists define an industrial revolution? What is a revolution and what is just some cool new technology?

What were those other two industrial revolutions?

What is going to be the fourth industrial revolution?

And will this make our modern economies look like the land before steam engines?

Never let a good crisis go to waste.

Winston Churchill’s famous words from the darkest days of world war 2 have taken on a more sinister meaning as the decades have passed. 

This quote was actually meant to be an inspirational message of hope to the British people but these days more cynical onlookers see that people with ill intent can use a crisis, just as well as those who are virtuous. 

The Great Reset is a collective name given to a series of economic policies that are attempting to use the recovery from the coronavirus as a way to supposedly build a better, brighter, more sustainable world.

This policy was first unveiled by the World Economic Forum and the United Kingdoms Prince Charles, and since this announcement, it has gathered support from a laundry list of economists, politicians, business people, and celebrities.
 
But it has also gathered a fair bit of criticism. Just 72 hours after it’s announcement a petition to stop it gained 80,000 signatures, which is kind of fair enough. 

The whole premise of this proposal does sound very ominous. Economic plans titled the great something have not exactly had the best track record. 

The fact that this plan is leveraging a disaster, alongside the fact that it is pushing some pretty spicy policies means that major conspiracies have been surfaced ranging from this plan will make us all poorer, all the way up to this plan will make us slaves to the lizard people. 

Now in fairness, the marketing around this Great Reset has not helped its case at all. If someone was to try and research what this plan actually was they would be presented with two extremely bizarre adds that explain absolutely nothing, and a 2 hour panel, which was extremely boring even to a major economics nerd like myself, and also kinda equally as unhelpful. 

We know this because well, we had to research this plan to make this video.

So it sounds like Some Economics need to be Explained 

And to properly do this we are going to need to answer a few questions. 

What is The Great Reset actually proposing to do?

Do these ideas have any merit?

Who are the players involved in pushing this agenda?

And is this actually a nefarious scheme or just the victim of terrible marketing?

The Economic Explained team uses Statista for conducting our research. Check out their YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuj2Bne141HGmYFsbkfnbqw

This is the Carnival Imagination, a luxury cruise liner worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which just 10 short months ago was touring passengers in extreme comfort to exotic destinations all over the world. 

This ship is sailing dead ahead to its final port of call, where it has been sold for scrap alongside dozens of other ships that have become the latest victims of the global pandemic. 

The Chittagong ship breaking yard in Bangladesh is the largest of its kind in the world, and in the past few months even its abundant shores have become inundated with pleasure cruises and industrial cargo ships alike that all could have otherwise sailed the oceans for many more decades. 

These are all very troubling signs for the unsung heroes of our modern global economy, the merchant marine fleet. Every year trillions of dollars worth of cargo is transported on ships like these and losing this fleet could turn into a huge barrier to global trade.

But what is really going on here?

Why would profit-motivated companies destroy billions of dollars worth of productive assets? Sure times are tough, tourism and trade have declined massively but this hardly looks like a reasonable response right?

I don’t burn down my house if a video gets less than 10,000 likes, so why would companies in such a competitive industry do something equally as self-destructive?

Well as always it has to do with economics (go figure) and to understand this bizarre behavior we need to understand a few key areas.

What are the economics behind the merchant marine fleet?

How do these factors make it financially viable to destroy ships?

what does this mean for the future of international trade?

And what does this all have to do with Chinese bridge building?

The United States 2020 Presidential election has been called by pretty much every organization that covers the event in any capacity and while the final decision is not made until the special club that is the electoral college has presented its final decision, it’s apparent that Joe Biden will be the next president of the united states. 

This is the first time in almost 3 decades that an incumbent president has been voted out before serving a second term and it has come in the midst of national and global catastrophes galore. 

To add fuel to a fire that threatens to ignite the global economy, the outgoing president has been vehemently challenging the results which is casting doubt over the smoothness of the transition, the continuation of much-needed government support, and the foundation of the nation’s systems in their entirety. 

And this all begs the question, either unwittingly or maliciously, how much damage could a president do to the American economy, and by extension the global economy. 

There are checks and balances in place to control the influence of any one man in the united states around things that were relevant when those checks and balances were been written. But it must be remembered economies back then depended a lot more on successful harvests, and a lot less on tweets. 

Our modern economies are incredibly complex and incredibly fine-tuned, but complex fine-tuned things tend to be very easy to break, and the outcomes of throwing a proverbial spanner into the works could be just as devastating. 

Thousands of people die when unemployment rises, and many more could lose access to healthcare, housing, and livelihoods during even a minor period of economic turbulence.

All of this is to say that a president waging war on an economy could be just as dangerous as waging war on a nation. 

So, what kind of influence does a president directly have over an economy?

Do they deserve the credit for things going well?

And what could a president do to tank the economy if they really wanted to?

This is the Netherlands, a picturesque nation filled with windmills, tulip fields, and uhh coffee shops. 

The nation is looked to by many as an extremely forward-thinking place that practices some pretty progressive policies. The nation has an incredibly strong social security system, with universal healthcare, robust retirement pensions, as well as allowances for maternity leave.

And These kinds of policies are mirrored in other areas as well, the nation is home to relatively high tax rates, and the protections for employees are very strong almost to the point that people joke it is impossible to be fired in the Netherlands. 

So this kind of looks like a liberal paradise right? Well, it would if it were not hiding a dirty little secret. 

This postcard-perfect little nation is according to the world bank the most unequal place on earth, and the extent of the inequality is simply staggering. 

We have explored south Africa on the channel before, which normally gets this less than a desirable title. And if you were to pose this question to google, it’s what you would walk away thinking. But this isn’t the whole story.

In terms of wealth inequality in recent years, South Africa has been pretty tame. The Netherlands by contrast is the only country on earth that is more unequal than the world itself.

So what is going on here?

Similar policies to the ones that have been commonplace in the Netherlands for decades are being proposed by politicians in places like the United States as a way to curb the issue of wealth inequality. But if we look at the results it doesn’t look like they will do that at all. 

So, to really understand this we are going to look at a few key issues.

How did the Netherlands of all places become the land of inequality?

What does this teach us about the nature of wealth in the modern world?

And how can this help us create more robust economic policies that work to benefit everyone?

And of course, while we are here we will call this a country video and put the Netherlands on the economics explained leaderboard.

China has been home to the most extreme economic growth in human history. In four short decades, the nation has gone from a struggling backwater filled with poverty to this, a nation of glistening skyscrapers and more Gucci stores than you can poke a stick at.

The driver of this growth has obviously been its embrace of the free market and opening itself up to international trade. 

The nation has always had huge potential, given that historically for 1,900 out of the last 2,000 years it has been the largest economy on earth, but now it is finally realizing that potential once again. 

Seeing this sustained growth people are obviously keen to jump on board, millions of dollars are been made by millions of people and any logical investor would be foolish to not have exposure to the largest growth market in the world right?

I spend a fair amount of time chatting to channel viewers on discord, Patreon, and even in the comments section of the video’s and it’s probably one of the questions I see the most, Mr economics man how can I invest in Chinese companies stock? 

Now I don’t want to sound rude, and I promise I absolutely mean this in the nicest possible way, but if you have to ask someone on youtube how you can invest in Chinese equities, you absolutely should not at all be investing in Chinese equities. 

And in fact even for more seasoned investors, the market for Chinese companies is not exactly the promised land of double-digit annual returns you may think it is. 

This is because there are a few major problems that have yet to be overcome, the stock market in China is both too regulated and not regulated enough. Which sounds silly but let’s explore it by looking at this problem piece by piece. 

How is the Chinese stock market over-regulated? 

How is the Chinese stock market under-regulated?

And why does this mean that most investors probably shouldn’t be investing in these markets? 

And alright alright, if after all of this you are still interested in learning how to actually buy shares in china I will show you how, but don’t say I didn’t tell you so.

This is Texas, the second-largest state in the USA by landmass, population, and GDP. 

But perhaps being runner up is not so bad in all of these categories. Texas has for many decades been a huge driving force of prosperity, not only for the people within the state but also for all of the USA.

The state provides over 40% of the oil production in the country which is, in turn, the largest oil-producing nation in the world. 

To give you an idea of just how massive this operation is, Texas produces more oil than, brazil and china combined. 

Now for regular channel viewers, you might be thinking that well that’s great and all however, oil wealth doesn’t always guarantee prosperity, but fortunately for Texas, it has diversified itself into a host of other industries some of which are very far removed from what you might picture taking place in the land of cowboy boots and ford f350’s.

Texas today has the fastest growing population in all of the United States which is been driven by the state attracting a range of new businesses that will work with this young new professional demographic to continue to grow a strong economy. 

Or at least that is the theory, the rumblings of the world in 2020 have not been easy on the Texan miracle, and for the first time in almost three decades, the state might be starting to show signs of troubled waters. 

To see if this could be a hurdle the yeehaw state could not overcome we need to look at a few key areas.

What have been the industries driving the growth of Texas?

What is it about the state that makes it so attractive to these industries?

And what could future growth look like after 2020?

Oh and of course while we are here we are going to put the state on the economics explained national leaderboard.

In the fallout of one of the most volatile American elections ever financial markets did something very strange, they rose, and rose to new record levels, again.

This would be unusual during even a normal election, where most investors tend to sit back and wait for the dust to settle but it is especially strange in 2020.

Joe Biden, who everybody is at least 90% confident will be the next president has spoken very openly about plans to raise corporate tax rates and this is coming in conjunction with the tension around how a transition of power may or may not take place, not to mention that global pandemic. 

If investors are supposed to fear uncertainty surely they would be terrified of the current world that we live in. 

Logic would dictate that the best outcome for the major corporations that make up financial markets would have been a nice simple and decisive Republican victory. At the end of the day, they tend to be a slightly more pro-business party.

Instead what they got was an extremely contentious Democratic victory with the potential to bring turbulence around key issues like covid relief packages in the coming month. 

So what is going on here

Why have markets rallied so hard in spite of this turbulence

Will this market boom reverse if the proposed policies of the Bidens campaign are rolled out.

And could it just be that investors no longer favored trump as president?

The war on drugs was declared in 1971 by president Richard Nixon in a press conference that went on to outline a plan to fight the trade of controlled substances across the world. Drugs were declared national enemy number 1. 

Since then over 1 trillion dollars have been spent on fighting this battle and by all metrics, it has been money poorly spent. 

It’s probably no surprise to anybody that drug-related deaths and crimes have done nothing but rise over the 50 years since Nixon made this declaration. 

With the benefit of hindsight, it was pretty easy to see why... you can’t fight the forces of supply and demand in unregulated markets with m16’s and government agents. 

Trying to do so would be like trying to fight a hurricane by dropping bombs on it. Not particularly effective and if anything it’s just going to cause even more collateral damage. 

But perhaps this is all starting to change, just last week during the election, the people of Oregon also voted on something else that will potentially have even more influence than who the next president is. 

The people of the state voted to decriminalize drugs, all drugs, even the hard stuff.

This might look like waving the white flag in defeat and finally admitting that drugs have won the war on drugs. But it might also be what we should have been doing all along, fighting the war on drugs with economics. 

To understand what economists mean by this we will need to look at a few key areas.

Why couldn’t the war on drugs disrupt this market?

What is driving the growth in this market?

And could legalization provide a better solution to dealing with this issue?

Tesla is today the most valuable automaker in the world by market capitalization beating out industry giants like General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen group, and even Toyota. 

It has achieved this impressive feet despite a short operating history, a limited product lineup, and even relatively modest sales figures compared to these much more established entities. 

In spite of all of these indicators, investors are willing to pay more than five times as much for the same stake in Tesla as compared to the more traditional automakers. 

So what is going on here?

What do investors see in Tesla that a rational person may not?

What is the companies vision to truly justify being valued this highly?

and could this all be a charismatic CEO taking a pool of naive investors for a ride?

This is Kazakhstan, and yes I know what you are all thinking, and yes in the interest of full disclosure we are definitely cashing in on the hype surrounding the second borat, but in fairness so is the nation itself. 

Even still this country is so much more than that with one of the most, hmm let's call it exciting economies in the world. 

What was once a mistreated soviet state has now gone onto be the largest and wealthiest economy in central Asia, one that is welcoming foreign trade, international investment, and advanced development of technologies to continue this growth into the future. 

On top of this, it is a central member of one of the most interesting, and influential however overlooked trading blocks operating in the world today. 

But of course, it has not been without its difficulties, it may very well be the most prosperous nation in central Asia, but central Asia is a rough old neighborhood to be the king of. 

What with It being home to some dream destinations like, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and also neighboring countries like Pakistan, and Afghanistan. 

By the way, a side note is that “stan” when translated from Persian just means a land of. So Kazakhstan kind of just translates to a land of Kazaks, which are the ancestral people of the nation. 

Hopefully, that gives some clarity to this rather samey naming scheme in and around this area. 

But all of this is to say that Kazakhstan hasn’t and won’t have it easy in its quest to become a properly developed nation but that doesn’t mean that it can’t do it. 

So to see what is behind this countries stubborn development we need to look at a few key areas.

What went on under Soviet rule?

What has the country been up to since the collapse?

what is their plan for the future?

Oh, and of course while we are here we have to put the nation on the Economics Explained national leaderboard.

The US federal election will be held in 2 days from when this video is published.

The process of electing who will go on to be the most powerful man in the world always makes for big news but perhaps never more so than in 2020. 

The United States is currently in the grips of a major health crisis that has caused untold suffering to people directly affected, and indirectly to people impacted by the economic consequences that came with it. 

This is all coming in combination with a mountain of other issues, wealth inequality, trade tensions, nationwide protests, a wildly unstable financial market, record-high levels of debts, and a host of other issues that are certainly getting less airtime in 2020 but are of no less importance. 

This election is a chance, at least in theory, for the citizens of America to have their say about how they would like these issues dealt with... and while there are more issues than ever the right solutions are desperately needed. 

Let’s get into it and look at a few key areas

The breakdown of both candidate's internal economic policies.

And the breakdown of both of their external economic policies.

The Impacts either election outcome will have on various markets around the world.

And how each of their plans for an economic recovery stack up against one another.

Pokemon is just fantastic, the video games, the show and of course the playing cards. 

Countless childhood hours have been spent on these pocket monsters, and well countless adulthood hours for that matter too, challenge me to a gen 6 random battle if you want to see just how many hours we are talking here. 

In and amongst all of this though these starry-eyed kids have grown up, found full-time jobs, and learned that the real world isn’t quite as fun as running around with your friends collecting gym badges. 

And perhaps this is part of the reason that certain pokemon cards are now worth more than most brand new cars. 

You may have seen this phenomenon slowly taking over the internet with YouTubers dropping hundreds of thousands of dollars on packs of pokemon playing cards. 

But what is going on here?

Surely a nostalgia trip is not worth a house deposit, even to people who are incredibly wealthy.

What’s more, is that this isn’t just some obscure market filled with eccentric millionaires, there are hundreds of thousands of participants, buying selling, and trading thousands of cards for millions of dollars every day, all during a time of massive economic turbulence where these same households might be struggling to find a job or pay rent. 

So 

What has been behind the boom in the value of Pokemon cards?

Could this be a genuine investment vehicle?

Or is this all heading towards being the next beanie baby bubble?

The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, or simply the Nobel Prize in Economics is an award given every year to thought leaders in the field.

This is one of 6 prizes given out the others recognizing similarly high achievers in literature, physics, medicine, chemistry, and of course the peace prize awarded for furthering the betterment of humanity. 

In and amongst all of the happenings in the world this year these awards have kind of flown under the radar which is unfortunate because they all recognized some very remarkable works.

And in the field of economics, it all had to do with auctions. 

Auctions to the average person might sound like a pretty mundane thing, you hop on eBay and bid for a new RTX 3080 before crying yourself to sleep, or maybe you are bidding for a new house to live in at a property auction. 

At the extreme end, we see auctions for works of art that sell for millions of dollars but even still the auction itself kind of just looks like a formality around which a transaction is done. 

But this is far from true. Auctions and Auction Theory are one of the most important systems to understand in economics because they act as an efficient way to build markets and correctly determine how we value items. 

Remember amongst everything economics is simply a study of how people interact with things of value. 

So with that in mind

What should the average person or aspiring economist know about Auction Theory?

What did the winners of this year's Nobel prize contribute to this theory?

And how can this be utilized to build better and more efficient economies?

If you were to ask any random person on the street what it is that they knew about economics there is a pretty good chance that the first thing that they would blurt out would be the words “Supply & Demand”

The number of people out there willing and able to buy a good or service versus the number of people out there willing to sell a good or service, all individually vying to get the best possible price. 

If demand increases prices increase, if demand falls prices fall and visa versa with supply. 

Now I know this channel is called economics explained but for most of you watching all of this should pretty much go without saying. 

The only issue is that this rosy picture is in no way a reflection of the real world. 

The price you pay for groceries, that new iPhone, or hey even the price that your employer pays you to do your job all have a lot less to do with supply and demand than you might expect.

This departure from perfect economic assumptions can also tell us a lot about what to actually expect during times of economic turbulence and properly-being able to predict how an economy works, in reality, can very easily be the difference between riding out an economic storm or being crushed by it. 

So what is going on here?

How are prices decided if not through supply and demand?

What does this mean for regular people in the economy?

How could all of this be used to make better policies and business decisions?

And how does this all make the case for a zero dollar minimum wage?

It’s the hope of almost every generation in history that their children and grandchildren will go on to live wealthier more prosperous lives than their own. 

People put countless hours of thought and planning into things like their children’s education, life insurance, and estate inheritance to make this dream a reality, but overwhelmingly it is still not coming true. 

The long-suffering generation of millennials are now set to be significantly poorer than both baby boomers and gen X’ers. 

Having entered the workforce during the fallout of the 2008 mortgage crisis and then being hit particularly hard during this current crisis has meant that today millennials only account for 3% of national wealth, where boomers at the same point in their lives accounted for 27%.

This trend is more than just another pity party for our fellow latte-sipping millennials. On a wider level, the share of wealth owned by people under the age of 40 has shrunk from 13% to just under 7% over the past 3 decades. 

Even if we ignore the social issues of younger families having to make do with half that of what their parents did this can have some serious economic implications. 

Young families establishing themselves in life make up a huge portion of consumer spending. Typically speaking people between the age of 25 and 40 have been seen as the perfect consumer market. They have full-time jobs and disposable incomes unlike younger buyers but lack a bit of the weariness of older consumers. 

Therefore if this trend continues businesses around the world might start to lose out on their Goldilocks zone of consumer spending. 

so …

What is causing this downward pressure on wealth in younger generations?

What will this mean for the future growth of nations like the USA?

And could this just be a waiting game of wealth, inevitably getting passed down?

This is California, the Golden State and one of the largest economies in the world in its own right. 

If California was counted as a sovereign nation it would be the fifth-largest in the world by GDP, with a 3.2 trillion dollar gross state product putting it just behind Germany and just ahead of India. 

The state has a lot going for it, from the largest movie and technology centers in the world all the way to a surprisingly strong agricultural sector. 

All of this has meant that the residents of California are on average doing very well for themselves, and one look around the wealthy enclaves of las Angeles and san Francisco would back this up.

Despite all of this however, the state is going through a period of economic turbulence. 

The economic fallout of the coronavirus has hit the state’s economy particularly hard. 

Major industries like tourism and media creation have ground to a complete halt having widespread knock-on implications throughout the economy hitting smaller vendors who were once reliant on these industries.

This bump in the road however was by no means the total undoing of the state.

California’s metrics before 2020 looked very strong, with low unemployment, solid growth, and booming industries, but there were still cracks forming. 

The state is home to the largest population in the US but the industries that were truly driving wealth creation are famously bad at actually employing people. 

This had led to a sharp increase in social issues like homelessness and crime.

All of these problems that were bubbling away under the surface have now been massively accelerated, so much so that many economists have predicted that the sun might be setting on the setting on the sunshine state. 

It may sound like absurdist alarmism but it is a reality that shouldn’t be dismissed. 

Remember in previous decades there was another economic region in the US riding high on the new growth industry of the age. but these days Detroit is not exactly seen as the bastion of prosperity it once was. 

So could the same grim reality be in store for California? Well to answer this we need to look at a few key areas.

What made the state so prosperous before the 2020 downturn?

What were the underlying issues impacting the economy?

How will these issues be impacted by this decline?

The bottom line is the most important part of any functioning business.

Profit after costs, expenses, and taxes. 

The money that the founders and investors in companies get to put back into their pockets for the risk and effort they put into a business. 

Sounds like business 101 right? And it kind of is.

A business that doesn’t turn a profit is like a freezer that kind make ice, it’s more or less pointless. 

And sure there are things like non-profit charity organizations out there but most businesses exist to make money!

So why is it that some of the biggest companies in the world are not turning profits? Why is it that they don’t even plan to?

The rise of so-called zombie companies or companies that have not and have never run at a profit are raising more and more eyebrows in the investing world. 

These businesses are getting too big to ignore as by some estimates over 10% of the s&p500 (an index of the largest companies in America), is now made up of these companies that don’t serve the one central goal of being in businesses. 

 What’s more, is that this issue is not just endemic to a particular industry, dozens of major companies and countless smaller businesses in every sector of the economy from energy, retail, medical, telecommunications, and of course technology are in this profitless boat together. 

So what is going on here?

Why would anybody invest in a business that is unprofitable?

What impacts does this apparent misallocation of resources have on the economy?

And finally, 

Will the economic fallout of 2020 show these businesses for what they really are?

Karl Marx and Frederick Engels were philosophers, political theorists, and economists responsible for writing the communist manifesto, which is today probably the most widely recognized text outlining a system for a communal economy. 

An economy where work is done to fulfill the needs of one's community rather than to satiate personal desires. An economy where goods and services are distributed by needs rather than by means. 

An economy where people could not rest on the laurels of being land or capital owners to get by without ever needing to contribute any personal effort. 

This system lies in direct contrast to the other extreme of the economic spectrum which is Laissez-Faire Capitalism. 

Laissez-Faire fair literally translating from french to let it be or leave alone pretty much sums up this economic system. It advocates for leaving capitalism alone entirely to do it’s thing because no government can allocate resources as efficiently as the free market. 

Both of these opposing theories are very extreme and for what its worth don’t exist in any modern economies anywhere around the world today, despite what some nations might have you believe. 

So what are the economic arguments for and against a communist economic system? 

What are the economic arguments for and against a completely free market?

And finally

Are there any examples of these extreme systems actually working throughout history?

There are over 10 million people in some form of government incarceration around the world today. There are 2.3 million in the USA alone and anyway you slice it that is a huge population of people.

The population of people living in prisons is larger than the population of people living in most countries on earth.

Locking people up is big business. And however you slice it, 10 million people are potentially a huge workforce. 

All of this can add up to have a very significant contribution towards national economies in more ways than you might expect. 

But as always we need to look at a few key areas to truly understand the economics of incarceration. So, what is the opportunity cost of having people locked up?

What impacts does this all have on the wider economy?

And finally: What impacts does the economy have on incarceration? 

Now while this all sounds like a pretty grim topic, that let’s be honest, most of you economics nerds watching, are never going to experience directly... it is still really important to understand. 

This is because despite the social impacts this system can have, there are some very serious positive and negative externalities caused by this system. 

In a heartless, clinical, sort of way, the study of economics could shed some insight into the system, by addressing…

The opportunity cost of the bars...

Inflation is something we more or less take for granted these days. The idea that 5 dollars today is not going to be able to buy 5 dollars worth of stuff in the future, and the fact that you used to be able to buy a family home for 10 grand, are all the result of inflation. 

The idea that over time money becomes worthless and less influences a lot of decisions in out lives. Everything from retirement planning to salary negotiations take this relatively benign and constant force into account. 

But it is something that should be feared. 

Hyperinflation is where this slow but steady force explodes and renders money all but useless. 

Since the money printers fired up in early 2020 the US has added over three trillion dollars to is m2 money supply. That’s more than a 20% increase in the total amount of money washing around in the economy in the space of around 6 months. 

What’s more is that 3 trillion dollars is coming close to doubling the amount of cash in active circulation, that is the pool of cash which is actively out there been spent on good and services rather than sitting dormant in bank accounts or term deposits. 

When you consider that hyperinflation is classed as a 50% increase in general prices per month it is reasonable to expect that this printing bonanza may be starting to push into dangerous territories.

Or is it?

Is hyperinflation actually something to be concerned about, in a developed nation like the USA? Or are all of these cautionary tales simply a ploy to try and get people to buy gold coins at 50% over their base value. 
Well to answer this we of course as always need to loot at a few key details and answer a few key questions. 

What actually is inflation? It’s weirder than you might think

Is inflation actually good or bad for the economy?

Is the money printer causing inflation right now?

And what are the best ways to protect against this harsh reality?

This is Taiwan, or officially, the Republic of China, a country in east asia, which if you can’t tell by how delicate I am being with these titles here is consistently under a bit of ehh let’s call it scrutiny. 

So contentious in fact that any country that is doing business with the people's republic of china, you know China, has to officially declare that they recognize the island of Taiwan as the sovereign territory of China.

While this is all very confusing, the fallout is that the nation of Taiwan is only officially recognized by a tiny selection of countries from around the world. 

These countries include economic superpowers like Guatemala, Haiti, the Marshall Islands and Vatican city collectively making up only accounting for around 50 million people and covering a tiny portion of world trade.

So it's not exactly like they have brought their A team there either. 

In Fact, about 2 thirds of the world's population that officially recognizes Taiwan as a nation are citizens of Taiwan. There are some sovereignty claims in outback Australia that have been more widely recognized than this nation of 23 million. 

Despite all of these substantial hurdles Taiwan powers on. It has a GDP per capita of $25,000 and an average net worth per citizen of $142,733.

Those are Per Capita GDP figures that are only beaten out by Japan and South Korea in the region. And average net worth figures that are only beaten by a very select group of the wealthiest most developed nations on the planet. 

So what is going on here?

Why are countries so quick to dismiss Taiwan as not a real nation?

What issues does this cause in an increasingly globalized world?

How is it that Taiwan has been so prosperous besides this?

GDP is one of the most universally recognized terms in economics. Even outside people with an interest in the subject most adults would be able to tell you that GDP is a measure of how large an economy is. 

They might not be able to tell you how it’s calculated or even what it stands for but they would get at least that part right. 

And you know what, that’s probably all they need to know, it might be all economists need to know about the figure, because it might be the extent of what this figure can tell us. 

Gross Domestic Product is a measurement of production in an economy, the idea is that the more stuff that is being created and transacted the wealthier the economy is and while this isn’t necessarily wrong it’s not the whole story. 

The tachometer is a measurement of your car’s performance. Higher revs on the dial, normally mean your car is going faster, but there is actually no way to know without other information, like if that car is in gear or even if that car has wheels on. 

This might be a bit of a rough analogy but in a world where people are becoming hyper-focused on GDP figures and what they mean for everybody amidst the chaos of 2020, it’s important to remember to check the other indicators. 

Something to keep in mind amongst all of this is that GDP is a macro-economic measure, it looks at the whole economy as an aggregate or a total collective. 

Sure the figures might not look great, but ask yourselves watching, did your lifestyle become 33% worse when a 33% drop in GDP was recorded?

For most of you watching I would imagine the answer is no, which might start to raise some eyebrows as to just how useful this measure is at telling economists what's really going on in the nations they are studying. 

So ...

What are the limitations of GDP?

Are there better figures to look at to get an idea of how prosperous an economy is?

And how could focus on something outside of pure productive capacity be good for our economy?

The Fire movement is a growing trend amongst young workers which is growing in popularity thanks to its very enticing goal which is spelled out in the name.

FIRE is an acronym of Financial Independence and Retiring Early. 

The idea is that by following a very aggressive saving and investing strategy people can get to a point where they are effectively retired at a very young age, sometimes younger than 30. 

In a world where we are being told that pensions are running dry and the average person may have to work in some capacity for their entire life, this sounds like a bit of a lofty dream. 

Sure, there are trust fund babies and young tech millionaires who may earn millions within their first few years in the real world, but surely kicking back on beach and never thinking about work again is not attainable to a regular wage slave right?

Well if some figureheads and internet forums are to be believed then well, yeah actually it is for pretty much anybody. 

Now in the interest of full disclosure, I am a passionate advocate for the financial independence movement. But that does not mean that I don’t see issues with it. 

Now many of those issues are glossed over in the sheer simplicity of it, which is also part of the reason it is so powerful. 

So long as someone can get to a point where their investments are making as much as their living expenses long term, they have achieved financial independence. 

Getting to that point is harder for some than others, but advocates of the movement argue that this difficulty has more to do with personal lifestyles rather than personal incomes. 

So what are the mechanics of the FIRE movement?

How could someone use it to stop working forever?

Is this actually attainable for anybody like they say?

And finally

What would this movement do to the wider economy?

Workers today are amongst the hardest worked individuals in history, while simultaneously being the most efficient. 

Sure, they have traded in grueling factory floors and coal mines for air-conditioned offices so they probably don’t get quite as much sympathy as their industrial revolution contemporaries but the world today is marred by different challenges.

Hustle culture and the glorification of roles like surgeons, investment bankers, and corporate lawyers have set a precedent of on-call all the time, under the guise of professionalism or being a team player.

Expectations and key performance indicators are increasingly monitored, scrutinized, and increased year on year. 

Now the discussion around overworking is not a new one, but it tends to focus on the mental health implications of this reality rather than the economic impacts. 

Now we are going to be leaving that aspect of this discussion to the side for this video and instead focus just on the economics of the overworked world.

Partially this is because there are many people far more qualified to talk about mental health and partially because well, sometimes for things to get changed it needs to make economic sense for them to be changed. 

So the health implications of 100 hour weeks aside, we really only need to answer one question. 

Does working longer and harder make for a more prosperous economy?

The economic impacts of 2020 have been felt far and wide and we have covered these problems in-depth in a handful of videos on this channel. But the logical question that most people are asking is what comes next?

Disasters happen and they are never pleasant but part of being a nation, a business, or even an individual is being able to deal with adversity and come out the other side.

Because of this people are expecting a recovery of sorts, and it seems like the only point of contention will be what letter of the alphabet this recovery will represent. 

Other speculations include a W-shaped recovery where we will see 1 recovery then another decline as the effects of government stimulus and relief packages wear off only to be followed by another genuine recovery later on. 

But amongst all of this, there is one type of recovery that we should all be very afraid of, one that is not getting nearly as much airtime and one that is actually being hurt by a lot of current policies and that is a K shaped recovery.

An economy is a collection of production and consumption processes that are all working towards solving the central economic problem. 

The problem is that we only have access to a finite amount of resources, but the potential for human consumption of goods and services is pretty much limitless. 

This is the foundation of economics, every study, every paper, every theory, economic policy, or experiment is ultimately an attempt to find a solution to a problem, that by its very nature, has no solution. 

Economics is considered a social science, and although some other scientists from more “rigorous” fields don’t always welcome it into their little club, it still follows the same processes to explore the world around us. 

And, as with science, or anything that is extremely complex for that matter, there are disagreements between practitioners at all levels of academia and throughout the entire history of the subject. 

The economic schools of thought are very broad ways that economists are clumped into basic groups. 

Now the first thing to know about all of these schools of thought is that they all agree with one another on most issues.
 
In the same way that two physicists will obviously agree with one another that and object at rest will remain at rest, but might disagree about string theory. Two economists will obviously agree that there are opportunity costs for every unit of production, but they might disagree on the long term implications of a consumption tax. 

The economy impacts our financial situations, our governments, retirements, environments, crime rates, and basically anything else that is going to make news headlines. 

As with anything that people are invested in they form opinions around it. And those opinions are held by everybody from Nobel laureate career economists to that crazy guy advocating for a seed-based economy. 

If this contention wasn’t enough then there is one other issue that makes these schools of thought difficult to deal with, and that is that there are no strong borders between them. 

There are plenty of economists that agree with some of the principles of one school of thought and then disagree wildly on some other areas. Which is actually a good thing. But more on that later. 

For now, to try and make sense of this wild world we are going to look at three major schools, Classical, Austrian, and Keynesian. 

To show the differences between these schools we are going to look at the way they suggest solving the central economic problem in key areas.

What they suggest the role of government is.

What do they think the role of the individual is.

What they propose doing in an economic crisis.

And finally what is the key to delivering a wealthier happier economy?

The market for alternative investments has been a really exciting field in recent years, with everything from bitcoins, to beanie babies being touted as the next must-have to outperform the boring old stock market. 

Now some of these investments have been good some of these investments have been bad, and many haven’t been around long enough to really tell yet, but the aftermarket for high fashion is a really interesting entrant into this world. 

Can things like sneakers really be considered an investment?

Or, are these people desperately trying to justify an irrational purchase?

What would one need to know before investing in these markets?

Who are the key players in this industry?

And most importantly: is this all just another speculative market bubble?

Vietnam is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world today. In 2019 its growth was only beaten out by a selection of far smaller and far more unstable national economies. 

With a huge and very hardworking population not to mention a powerful ally to it’s north this could be the country to watch out for in the next 10 years.

But this success is by no means guaranteed. As with many other nations in the Southeast Asian region, it has many hurdles it needs to deal with to become a fair dinkum developed economy. 

The middle-income trap, global trade hostilities, and an increasingly competitive global market for manufacturing.

Oh and if all of this wasn’t enough let's not forget a global pandemic and ensuing economic crisis to really spice up this obstacle course on their journey to success. 

All of these factors make Vietnam a fascinating country to explore and use as a case study for some very intriguing economic questions. 

Foremost amongst these is a challenge to the assumption that all nations can become developed economies, so long as they embrace industry, and free trade and free markets. 

So, 

What has been behind Vietnam’s Economic Growth?

What will the impacts of 2020 do to this growth?

And perhaps most importantly

How will this nation break into the Developed Nations club?

China is not playing fair in the game of global trade, they are cheating other countries, companies, and consumers out of business by Manipulating their own currency. 

So how does a nation like china control their currency?

Can this actually be used to give an unfair advantage in global trade?

If it can, why doesn’t every country do it?

Can businesses profit from this man-made market failure? 

And does a currency price even matter?

Student loans are financial tools that have been put in place to give promising individuals the ability to get an education and increase their potential for future earnings with a strong professional career. 

On a nationwide level having a well educated and skilled workforce is one of the strongest determinants of economic success. We have seen this time and time again with nations like South Korea, Japan, Switzerland and Germany, who are not necessarily blessed with a wealth of natural resources or great geography but nonetheless hold their own as some of the world's wealthiest nations. 

For all of these reasons, young men and women from around the world have grown up with the idea that their education is the best investment they can make… 

... but is it?

The News Media Bargaining Code is a proposed piece of legislation currently under review by the Australian parliament, that would work effectively to abolish the level playing field of the internet within the country. 

Now for all of you watching that are not Australian, don’t breathe a sigh of relief, because this will still impact you. 

The law would mandate that registered media organizations would have key insights into how googles back end systems work, including access to users data, privileged analytics, and unfair compensation.

Physical cash is one of the easiest ways to instantly and reliably conduct commerce. 

It has been well-documented that the ease of transactions within a nation is as big of a determinant of a country’s success as is access to natural resources like oil and natural gas, or even a well-educated population.

So, what would happen if we got rid of cash?

There are a lot of things that we take for granted in our day to day lives, and one of the big ones is how we spend a good portion of our waking hours.

Based on sophisticated youtube analytics we can determine that a majority of people watching this video are full-time employees working 40 hour weeks at their jobs

So is 40 hours really the optimal work week, and are their alternatives that are based more on economics rather than tradition?

The wealthiest generation in history is starting to retire, and die. 

In doing so they will be responsible for the greatest wealth transfer in history, as they pass along a collective 30 trillion dollars to their beneficiaries over the next few decades, just in the united states alone.  

That kind of capital movement is going to have some extremely significant impacts on the economy some of which we are already starting to feel.

Last Thursday on the 30th of July 2020, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis released its 2nd quarter Gross Domestic Product report.

The report noted a 32.9% contraction in annual GDP growth in the months of April, May, and June. 

For reference, the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis of 2008 saw an 8% drop in annualized GDP figures at its peak.

_XgU6ZT1QDk,Economics Explained,"Why 40,000 People Die for Every 1% Increase in Unemployment - The Big Short","the big short was a fantastic movie, for finance nerds and regular viewers alike. One of the lines that stood out the most, amongst many memorable lines, was the claim that for every 1% increase in unemployment 40,000 people die. 

This is an incredibly significant claim, that adds even more weight to the already significant societal issues that come along with people out of the job. 

So is this claim actually true?

People are told from the time they get their first job to save money.  Save for a car, have an emergency fund, send your kids to college, a house deposit, oh and not to mention retirement (if that is still a thing). There are a million things to save for and on an individual level, it is almost always a good idea.

So why is it then, that governments and businesses from around the world are so terrified of people saving money?

The wealthiest among us today live a life unparalleled by any other human throughout history.

The greatest Kings and emperors could only dream of the life afforded to today’s billionaires.

It doesn’t end there, even mere multi-millionaires are living through a time where they have access to limitless information, unhindered mobility, and personal comforts.

But this is all taking place at a time where a swelling population of people are struggling to make ends meet.

Our world is home to over 190 countries using 180 currencies to trade, invest, and collect taxes. The global economy is complex at the best of times and the foreign exchange, or forex market only looks to add an additional layer of confusion and complexity.

So this begs the question could the world adopt a single universal currency?

This is Adam Smith. Adam Smith was a Scottish philosopher and author who is probably best known for writing a book titled “An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of … The Wealth of Nations!”

This book effectively marked the beginning of economics as an academic discipline as Adam Amith, (now heralded as the father of economics) laid the foundation for economic rules and principles that guide decision making the world over.

There are all manner of factors that make poor countries poor and rich countries rich. Many of these factors we have explored in depth when we have looked at economies like the democratic republic of the Congo all the way up to places like Switzerland and Norway. 

Political Stability, industry, natural resource wealth are all incredibly important variables but there is something extra here that just doesn’t seem to make sense.

In two short decades, Amazon has grown from a modest online bookstore to an international conglomerate. A conglomerate that seems hellbent on moving into every growing industry out there.

Amazon will only be the second company this channel has ever explored but it is extremely important to understand for a few reasons. most curiously, why amazon is pushing for reform in key areas that wouldn't really be expected...

The 2008 Global Financial crisis was kicked off by major structural issues in the global banking system and exacerbated by record levels of household debt.

Today the world is on the brink of yet another major financial downturn, and yet again household debts are at record levels. 

So is banking really to blame?

Game Theory is supposed to show how businesses (and prisoners) can outdo each other to win out over their competition. While this is great in theory Game Theory actually shows us much more about how to get along with our partners, friends, and allies.

Australia is a major world economy, with highly developed industries and close to 25 million of the wealthiest citizens in the world. 

But Australia is harboring a deep, dark secret ... it is an American company! 🇺🇸

Hong Kong has done very well for itself as a global-middle-man. And the meteoric rise of its neighboring economy, China, has only strengthened the city’s already-prosperous position. 

But, of course, if you follow the news, you probably already know that Hong Kong has seen better days. Global trade tensions, prolonged protests, and good-old-fashioned competition have dramatically impacted its economy in recent years.

France is a global trendsetter for other economies.

This goes from the rollout of the metric system to more tangible short term indicators. If you want to predict the future, look to France.

This is not to say that the country is any further ahead than any other developed nation. In fact, in many ways, it is quite the opposite, but the industries they choose to engage in making them a great indicator for global economic performance.

Taxes are an unfortunate reality for most people living and working in the modern world, we pay them every year, we complain about them, and then we forget them until next year. 

Taxes are one of the most important elements of any economy around the world. Entire societies can grow from effective taxation and crumble without it.

In 2017, at Christie’s Auction House in New York, a mysterious #Art buyer bid a record-breaking $450 million dollars for the #SalvatorMundi; a painting by the legendary Leonardo da Vinci.

News of the staggering purchase price sent shockwaves throughout the entire art market (which, interestingly, has been a reliable indicator of impending market bubbles for decades). 

What drives the high-end #ArtMarket? How can art be used to move money in creative ways and get around taxes? And perhaps above all, why would anyone park so much money in a picture when there are other asset classes that actually generate cash, like real estate rentals or dividend-paying stocks? … all this and more in today’s episode!

Brazil is currently the 9th largest economy in the world, according to the International Monetary Fund.

This means that if the nation does make the jump from developing to developed, it could rival economic superpowers like Germany, Japan, or the United Kingdom. 

And as crazy as it may sound, it may become an economy that rivals the USA or China.

This is Liechtenstein just the cutest little European nation, the nation is tiny but weirdly enough it is actually only the fourth smallest country in Europe, behind Vatican City, Monaco, and San Marino.

What it lacks in square footage though it more than makes up for in economic might. You see this country is home to the second richest people in the world with a GDP per capita of $165,000 which is second only to Monaco, and the country is, at least officially home to some truly wealthy old moneyed elite.

So hedge fund is a term that has really lost a lot of meaning in recent years. These days it basically just means a managed financial institution that facilitates complex investment strategies that cater exclusively to high net worth individuals. But that wasn’t always the case. You see hedge funds actually have a really specific role in the world of high finance and in this video we are going to find out what makes them work.

Most people would agree that recessions are terrible things, they cause widespread fear amongst people that will be anxious about their savings, their livelihood, or even their next meal.

On a nationwide level, economic downturns are events akin to natural disasters, they do massive damage and for the most part are widely accepted by society as an “inevitability”, rather than a “rarity” …

But do we really need recessions?

China's Belt and Road initiative is set to be the most influential economic development project in recent history. It’ll be an investment measured in trillions, connecting dozens of nations with roads, rail lines, shipping routes, and most important of all: trade deals. 

But for all of the impressive figures, there’s an equally concerning list of problems centered around the nation that looks to be the ringmaster of this whole project.

Inarguably, it's pretty bad right now.

Businesses are closing, unemployment is rising, and people are scared for their health. 

Fortunately, governments are coming to the rescue with a swath of economic bailouts, stimulus checks, and hardship support.

And since we're living through an event that will shape economic policy for generations to come, it's an ideal time to explore what economic responses we want to replicate in the future, as well as which government policies have completely fumbled the economic response of 2020.

By doing this, we should be able to analyze the efficiency of government spending for the purposes of creating a strong economy.

Say you find yourself sitting on top of a vast fortune of funds that were acquired legitimately (or otherwise), and let's just say this vast fortune propels you to billionaire status. Congratulations! You've made it! ... well, sort of. All that’s left to do now is make sure your fortune is secure for generations to come (and not lost as quickly as it was made).

But before you can enjoy the high life, you are going to need to first check-off a few things. Luckily you are in the right place. So, take out your notepad and pen, this is the first video in a two-part series on how to become the master of your finances.

A home is in most developed nations in the world the centrepiece of the family finances, it is simultaneously the largest investment and largest expense of almost any individual lucky enough to break it to this increasingly unattainable market with a massive mortgage. 

But is this all for the best? Have houses been conflated with poker chips, as people no longer look at them as shelter for a growing family but rather as an asset to make wild speculative moves on in the hope of equally wild returns.

The property market was at the centre of the last financial downturn in 2008, and as it seems we are on the precipice of another major recession it is probably a prudent time to re-evaluate what is going on with the world of real estate.

To do this we are really going to have to look at things on a few level’s from the macroeconomic factors like over-development and over-leveraging to issues on an economy-wide level which is ultimately going to boil down to answering a few key questions: What does a strong property market mean for the wider economy? Are their better investments out there? And are we over-leveraged right now?

The wild ride of 2020 continued this week with the news that the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un was in a critical condition and that his continued leadership of the nation was not necessarily guaranteed.

This has, of course, generated all manner of speculation given how secretive the hermit kingdom is at the best of times but even more so now as its future really is up in the air.

So, with that, there are a few key issues we must explore here. What will the potential economic outcomes of leadership change be why is it that a dictatorship inherently makes for a poor economy? What the potential outcomes will be for North Korea will be in the future. How countries have dealt with this type of situation in the past. And perhaps initially what is it that would stand in the way of a country like North Korea embracing a modern economic system, what keeps them poor.

Ancient Rome was perhaps the most significant ancient civilization to have existed throughout history, the empire lived for over 1000 years and in that time, it gave us the foundations for our modern society. Democracy, a court-based legal system, Latin languages and alphabet, three-course meals, and perhaps it was one of the first modern economies to move beyond a simple agrarian empire and develop things like modern banking, lending, taxation and yes even financial crisis as we know them today. 

In the same way that scholars study a dead language like Latin to discerned the foundation of meaning in our modern dialects economists can study the histories of ancient civilizations like Rome to determine basic economic functions in a time before modern financial systems could skew results and Rome was perhaps the most developed case study we could look at.

Earlier this week we've started seeing articles noting that oil prices have now gone into the negatives (meaning investors are paying to give away their oil).

What is going on here? How does this make sense?

As always with these weird and wonderful things, it's all basic economics. And to properly understand this, we're going to need to look at 3 things: Negative value items, the 2020 oil market, and how oil is actually sold!

Is there such a thing as ""good debt""? And how could something good cause so many issues? On top of this is there any way that we could just run an economy without debt and would we be better off for doing so. Well, it turns out we probably can, and in fact, there are many economies around the world today that are developing rapidly while going without this system that we just assume is a given.

If we can critically explore these questions it will offer insight into how our modern financial system works, and why it means that despite our best efforts we are almost destined to go into a recession once every 10 years or so.

This is China, what is still the world's foremost industrial economy has apparently been knocked down a peg as it emerged into the new decade.

There has been wild speculation about companies divesting from the country as a response to the critical flaws in supply chains that have been brought to light. The world today is heavily reliant on China to manufacture almost everything we take for granted in our modern lives. 

Report’s of companies desperately looking for supply chain alternatives and speculation about countries that are going to move in to take their place have been all over the news, and perhaps there is some merit to this speculation, but a lot of this may be un-grounded in genuine economics and rather just be the product of things people want to be true.

It looks like this external shock will snowball on top of some underlying faults in the economy to cause an economic crisis that eclipses the 2000’s tech bible and the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008.

Most people of note from policymakers to money managers agree that this is pretty bad and it only looks like it is getting worse ... so why is it then, that amidst all of this chaos and uncertainty the stock market is on the rise again?

Economic growth is something that is important to every global citizen today.

But it's not something to necessarily take for granted – we are certainly not ""owed"" long-term growth. We must earn it. And above all, we must continue innovating to become more efficient.

Simultaneously, society must collectively address the major issues that we're inevitably set to face within this century if we wish to ensure that future generations live better than their predecessors.

Modern Monetary Theory is something so simple yet so complex all at the same time, it does really involve divorcing your mind from how you personally interact with money to ultimately grasp how cash works at an economy-wide level.

A lot of supporters of the theory push it as a cure-all to any economic ailments, and you know what with the money printers firing away like they are right now we may finally get a chance to find out if they are correct, but in reality, it’s not a prescription to fix a broken economy as much as it is an insight into how modern economies work.

In 1929, years of wild debt-fuelled speculation over company stocks came to a halt with the worst economic disaster in history. In 2001, years of wild debt-fuelled speculation over technology companies that were apparently going to revolutionize the future came to a halt when most were shown to be worthless. 

And, in 2008, years of debt-fuelled speculation from borrowers that just needed that 5th investment properties and the bankers that were more than willing to accommodate this to sell some more mortgage bonds, came to a grinding halt when people realized that everything propping up this speculation was based on absolute garbage.

As of making this video, we have just lived through the fastest 30% market decline in US history – outpacing all of the examples listed above. And it's easy to think ""this time is different"". 

But it is not...

On December 11th, 2019, The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia launched its initial public offering of Saudia Aramco onto the Tadawul public stock exchange.

The companies initial offering actually went quite well after an unprecedented marketing campaign which before this event was pretty much unheard of.

On the second day of trading, the company hit a market cap of 2 trillion dollars, easily eclipsing Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft to go on and become the single most valuable company in history.

Once the seat of the Roman Empire, Italy is now home to a surprisingly robust yet temperamental economy. 

The economy of Italy followed a path very similar to that of Germany's, albeit, with a little more flamboyancy which has found them where they are today.

Despite its many critics, Mexico has some surprisingly strong economic characteristics. A great export market, a thriving manufacturing industry, natural resources, a young and productive workforce, and even things like geography are all on its side.

But the nation still has critics. And some of that criticism isn’t entirely unfair, as things like crime is still an issue. And as strong as Mexico’s legitimate economy and export market is, we still all know deep down the other export market that Mexico is home to.

Space exploration has long been the dream of science fiction authors and enthusiasts well before we even had the technology to explore life beyond our own planet.

Today, astronauts live year-round in low-earth orbit aboard the ISS (International Space Station). We have put men on the moon, and we have companies that are said to be commercializing space. But, all of this begs the question: what will space exploration actually do for humanity?

South Korea, a highly-developed and wealthy economy that epitomizes the story of a modern Asian nation, has made the transition from a very poor to very rich in less than one life's generation.

Today, the nation is a glistening beacon of technological innovation that leads the world in highly productive and profitable industries.

In this episode, we'll explore how South Korea proves how solid economic management is far more important than natural resources in determining a country's destiny.

Trillion-dollar mega corporations are a very big deal these days. Only about 2 or 3 exist in the modern world and they're primarily tech companies that have achieved this status by capitalizing on cutting edge modern technology (and probably a bit of optimistic speculation). But there is one corporation that has snaked its way through history and may have very well been the largest corporation in history.

This was a company that laid the foundations for modern multinationals and created systems, procedures, and expectations that we take for granted today.

This is Greece, a fantastic European Mediterranian nation that has been famed in recent years for its not so fantastic economy. 

Greece in the 21st century looks like many other middle-of-the-road developed economies, it has had and still does have a lot of things going for it, it has a huge tourism industry, one of the largest per capita in the world, and its exotic islands and ancient landmarks still attract millions every year bringing with them all those wonderful tourist dollars. In this video, we explore how a once healthy nation got everything so wrong.

This is the United States of America today: The largest most powerful economy to ever exist in history. In previous episodes, we have explored how the economy of the USA has developed from a British colony into an industrial powerhouse that rose to the position of power that it occupies today.

Which brings us to America in the 21st century. When a lot of people think of powerful economies they'll imagine huge factories, shipping ports, plentiful farmland, and powerful investment banks. But, in reality, what keeps the world spinning is simply debt and demand.

The Philippines, a beautiful tropical archipelago of islands that forms one of the most important economies in the world today. This nation often flies under the radar as a quiet achiever but it is both interesting and important to understand because it may be the quintessential 21st-century growth nation, and that is not to say it is some super modern nation from the future, but rather it is to say that the story of the success and failures of the Philippines is by extension the story of the world today as more and more countries, modernize, embrace technology, trade internationally and bring their citizens into the global middle class.

Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, two gentlemen fighting back and forth for the title of world richest man. These two individuals seem very very similar, for starters, of course, they are both billionaires, an elite worldwide club with around 2 and a half thousand members, they are both white, male tech entrepreneurs, from the united states, and even more specifically from Seattle, and even more specifically their primary residence is in Medina a same small town just outside of Seattle. So it looks like these two are pretty similar, but in reality, their fortunes couldn’t be more different.

China has come along way.

As of the time of this writing, the communist country is the second-largest economy in the world and looks poised to reclaim its title as the world's largest economy within the next century.

So without further ado, let's explore modern-day china and see how it has transformed from a half-crippled state into the economic superpower we know today.

The Soviet Union is one of the most historically significant economies to understand, not only because it was the home to some of the most controversial economic practices ever, not only because it was a nation that altered world politics for the latter half of the entire twentieth century, or because it was home to one of the largest and most rapid economic declines in modern history, no no, all of that stuff is important and we will explore it, but more important than all of that is that even today, almost 30 years after the fall of the soviet union, the lessons of the nation and its economy are having lasting implications on the world today.

This is the Entropia Universe, a massively multiplayer online game set in a science fiction universe full of spaceships and fantastic curiosities. It is a game where players can choose from a wide variety of professions to occupy themselves with which in turn builds a diverse and functioning economy. 

Entropia universe is worth discussing because of one very small aspect that makes a very big difference. The currency in the Entropia universe can be traded back and forth for real-world money, meaning it is effectively a video game that you play using real-world currency. And it was also an entirely exchangeable digital currency that existed 7 whole years before bitcoin came onto the scene.

South Africa is an economy that is really important to understand as a kind of potential outcome case study of inequality gone bad. The nation itself, on paper at least is not so terrible, it is actually one of if not the wealthiest nation in all of Africa, trading back and forth quite frequently with Nigeria.

This is Iran, a highly controversial nation that has of course made headlines in recent months for hostilities back and forth between the united states. Hostility towards the united states is really nothing new in and of itself but these particular hostilities have gained so much attention in part because Iran is a very very powerful military nation in its own right. Now a lot of that power comes down to its economy which gives it the ability to be a force that people actually fear to engage with.

Even outside of hostilities and fear-mongering the economy of Iran is a really interesting case study because it is one of the largest modern economies that draws policy not only from economic and political theory but also directly from the teachings of Islam, which gives it some really interesting characteristics.

Sweden is a beautiful Scandinavian country famed for its beautiful people, flat-packed furniture, PewDiePie and meatballs. Now of course if you hadn’t guessed by the channels title we are only here to look Sweden's economy, and it is a remarkable one at that. Sweden is home to one of the highest standards of living in the world and is often held in extremely high regard when it comes to workers rights and general quality of life indicators such as working hours, happiness rates and life expectancy. It is also a nation with a rich history of setting the trend for other economies to follow, Sweden is home to the Riksbank founded in 1668 it is the oldest central bank in the world, blazing the path for monetary policy that dictates every major economy in the world today. 

So how did it get here. We have explored rich nations with strong welfare systems that seem to do everything right on the channel before…  most notably Norway, Sweden's little brother the to west… But Sweden is slightly different in the sense that it was not blessed with the Norwegian sea and its abundance of oil and gas, so it was not able to build up a sovereign wealth fund with oil profits like Norway was and so on paper it is citizens are poorer than Norway's but their quality of life seems exactly the same.

China was once the wealthiest in the world and now it was struggling to feed itself, it was these kinds of conditions that gave rise to the political system that would go on to define china in the latter half of the twentieth century.

The nation boasted this wealth for a majority of the last millennia only ever trading places with India, another nation that flies under the radar in recorded history. It even achieved and maintained a level of wealth beyond the typical colonial powers like England, France, and the Netherlands that we typically associate with world domination in this period and it did it through good old fashioned grunt.

In this video, we'll explore how it all went wrong in the 20th century.

This is Germany, the largest economy in all of Europe by a significant margin and the fourth largest in the world falling just behind Japan. The economy of Germany is so interesting not just because of its size though but more because it’s a tenuous and surprisingly short history.

Germany is a hugely influential economy in the world today and even more so amongst other European economies, it has been a stabilizing force in the euro-zone and its prosperity has overflowed into regions that have been less stable.

A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. The star wars universe centered in this galaxy has of course been the center of many stories filled with action intrigue and mindless cash grabs for toy licensing, but it is also home to an amazingly developed economy.

No fictional universe that I know of has the level of depth that the star wars universe has garnered, from the movies, the games, the books, and even the fan fiction it has all built a surprisingly tangible reality in this fictional universe. 

A large part of that reality is the surprisingly realistic economy that has been fleshed out in the narrative of the star wars universe. The economics of galactic trade and military spending is a long way from the center of the stories but it is still a foundation that whether intended or not gives an added layer of realism to a science-fiction franchise about space wizards.

The Christmas Crash of 2018 was a really important case study that up until now has been pretty much forgotten and even when it was happening probably didn’t get the attention it should.

What was the Christmas crash? What caused it? And why did everything pretty much go straight back to normal immediately after the new year?

This is China: the second-largest economy in the world, home to the largest population in the world, and the most aggressive economic expansion in modern history.

Most people watching this video now would have seen China go from a collection of mostly peasant farmers into the economic powerhouse it is today within their lifetimes.

The economic development of China has amongst other things also contributed heavily to the massive drop in absolute global poverty we have seen today.

This is the arctic: home to a small specialized economic zone that doesn’t technically belong to any established nation on earth.

The North Pole is an interesting economic case study, primarily because of its surprisingly incredible economy! ... So put on your jacket and stay warm for today's episode as we explore the economy of The North Pole!

This is Russia: the largest country on the planet by pure landmass. The country is the center of many controversies that have today made it a bit of a boogeyman in the international community. 

It is enormous military power with the largest nuclear arsenal in the world even beating out the United States which comes as a hangover from when the nation was the centerpiece of the Soviet Union. 

But we are not here to look at Russian military assets or speculate about the wild conspiracies that Vladimir Putin is inevitably plotting in the Kremlin as we speak. We are not even here to look at the Soviet Union that one deserves a video all its own, no we are here to explore modern-day Russia, which is an economy that really is just not that impressive. 

Russia is hugely powerful by virtue of its military and political influence but its economy is really nothing to be proud of. Its current GDP of around 1.7 trillion USD is certainly nothing to be ignored, it puts it in line with countries like Canada or Brazil but it does not put it in line with the world powers like China or the USA which is normally compared too.

The economy of the United Kingdom is really a tale of two cities, it was the best of times and it was the worst of times, it is an economy with the highest levels of foreign investment per capita in the world and it is an economy with a major poverty crisis. It's an economy that's home to the second-largest financial center in the world and yet its entire economy is smaller than that of California.

In this video, let's explore why these financial institutions decide to call London home.

The United States became the world's largest economy in the early 20th century and though massive industrial growth and technical innovation it has held that lead for over 100 years.

The world superpowers that came before it was most notably colonial empires, with the France Britain and the Netherlands all extracting a vast majority of their wealth from foreign colonies that they used to mine natural resources or grow tea and spices to bring back home.

Incidentally, the United States was once one of these colonies, but it had a bit of a rebellious streak and claimed independence to go an to become a majorly powerful nation in its own right. 

The nation was born with the memories of empire and what it meant to be a colony, so it ultimately walked a different path to prosperity. In this video, part two of a serious on the economy of the United States we will look at America’s take on its own global empire.

The Netherlands, a fine country of flowers, windmills, and loose regulations around the finer things in life. This country is in many ways like a lot of very developed European economies we have explored earlier on the channel, very high living standards, good social mobility a strong economy and healthy inequality but the Netherlands hides a bit of a secret behind its lovely flowerful smile, it is one of the largest tax havens in the world. 

But how does this make any sense? The Netherlands has a high-income tax rate of over 50% for top earners and a corporate tax rate of 25%. And there are not even particularly strict laws around things like banking privacy (like there are in countries like Switzerland) ... so if all of this is making the Netherlands sound like a pretty terrible tax haven all in all, why is it so popular?

The United States of America, the wealthiest, most powerful nation on the planet by a very respectable margin. The sheer scale of the united states wealth and influence is really really hard to fathom, even for macro-economists, sure there are GDP figures, trade balances and labor force figures, but they are best for telling the story of a normal national economy, and the United States are far from that, its consumer retail sector is bigger than all but 9 of the largest national economies in the world, California, one of its states has a bigger GDP figure than the united kingdom and the US has fifty states. 

The U.S. economy goes beyond this though, it is the foundation for the world economy in the 20th and 21st centuries, and this influence isn’t caused by something so old fashioned as an empire, but rather industry. Today US companies can be seen dominating industries in economies all over the world, and at the same time, foreign companies from Europe and Asia fight endlessly to break into the US market, the largest and most influential consumer market in the world.
 
The U.S. economy is too large with too many facets to explore in a single video, so this will be made as a video series but for now, in this video, I want to explore how the United States of America got to where it is today.

The New York Stock Exchange is the world's largest and most liquid securities market.

It's where many of world's largest companies list their shares to be traded amongst millions of investors worldwide; ranging from small individual investors to major financial institutions and governments.

But the NYSE isn't the only exchange. In fact, there are hundreds of exchanges around the world that also work to raise capital for corporations.

And while you're probably familiar with the classic imagery of loud bombastic traders in bright uniforms when you think of stock exchanges, the reality is quite different.

The age of the automated trading machines is upon us and most trades executed today aren't coming from humans but rather algorithmic trading machines.

These computer algorithms (or ""algos"") come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. But the most controversial of all is known as ""high-frequency trading"" or ""HFT"".

▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀

Global warming is something that threatens to impact us all: both environmentally (with the loss of natural marvels such as the great barrier reef) and economically.

But humans aren't actually contributing as significantly as you may think to global warming.

In fact, the vast majority of the world's population lives a relatively low-carbon emission lifestyle compared to ""the developed world"".

Yet, ironically, the world's poorest citizens are the ones most likely to be impacted by the potential byproducts of a warmer planet.

In this video, let's explore the economic impacts of climate change – both in terms of its potential consequences and the feasibility of available solutions.

This is Singapore, a city-state nation just off the coast of Malaysia it is one of the most praised and highly regarded economies amongst the business community in the world. It was up until recently ranked by the world bank as the easiest country in the world to conduct business, but it has recently been usurped by new Zealand of all places so make of that what you will. Even been content with its silver medal though Singapore has made itself a central home of finance, business, and trade for all of southeast Asia which is remarkable considering it is a nation without much in the way of land, resources, or even a particularly large population. 

Singapore has obviously had some advantages, it was in the right place a the right time both economically and geographically to capitalize on the growth of Asia as a global region of trade. But prosperity wouldn’t have just happened to a small little spit of land off the coast of Malaysia with very little in the way of arable land or natural resources. It did the right things to ensure it was the go-to a middleman for as much as it could be a part of in the region by developing the right mix of the right economic policies and not containing itself to one ideology to dictate the direction of the entire nation.

Venezuela. Once the richest country in all of Latin America, it is now home to the single greatest economic downturn for a country in modern history. In terms of countries that had it easy, Venezuela, by all counts, should be at the top of the list. It's home to the largest oil deposits in the world – easily beating out the typical oil giants like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab eremites ... but they squandered it.

A lot has been said about the political issues surrounding the downfall of Venezuela, and don’t get me wrong there have been plenty of political issues, but in this video, we will just focus on the fundamental economics behind Venezuela's unprecedented rise and its devastating fall.

This is Canada, a highly advanced first world country blessed with an abundance of natural resources and polite people. This nation is often a side though when compared to its far more influential and much louder brother to the south, but Canada is an extremely important economy in its own rights with a few key contributors that make it truly unique in the western hemisphere. For starters, it is a commonwealth country meaning that while it is a free and independent state, it still takes a lot of its lessons from its mother back across the Atlantic ocean. 

The nation is also blessed and cursed by its own geography and anther issue worth exploring is the love/hate relationship that Canada has had with skilled immigration in the past decades. 

In this video, we'll explore the issues facing Canada and look respectively at how they are the perfect case study for the world as a whole.

In July of 2009, The Central Bank of Sweden lowered its overnight deposit rate to negative 0.25% – effectively charging the country's retail banks to pay it to look after its money.

At the turn of the millennia, negative interest rates were somewhat of an economic fantasy: the same way that light-speed travel is a fantasy for theoretical physicists. Economists had speculated about what negative interest rates would mean, but nobody actually ever expected this phenomenon to exist in the real world.

Today, negative interest rates dominate the market for sovereign bonds and are the staple of many central banks. But how in the world does this make sense? Who in their right mind would pay someone to take their money? ... all this and more in today's episode!

Trump. A man who needs no introduction. Today, let's look exclusively at President Trump's economic policies, go over their quirks and features, and more!

Trump is one of the few candidates we can actually talk about so early in this election cycle because, of course, he is the incumbent president. So, we don’t have to speculate about his promised economic policies. We can actually look directly at the policies that he has already enacted.

Trump’s policies are quite notable in two distinct fields where he has taken relatively assertive action, foreign, and domestic economics.

This is Westeros: the fictional nation that is home to a majority of the story of Game of Thrones, an ongoing book series, and wildly popular TV show.

For the sake of this video, we'll attempt to put to the side that Westeros is very obviously middle ages England and Essos (the other land featured prominently in the story) is based on Europe and Mediterranean nations around the turn of the renascence.

This was obviously an inspiration for George RR Martin, but the writer has gone beyond that and interlaced curiosities from many historic economies into a world that adds a layer of complexity and realism that isn’t present in typical fantasy stories of the genre.

So, let's explore how they work together and add to the narrative that drives The Game of Thrones.

The world of cryptocurrency began as little more than an experiment in computer engineering circles and has since evolved into (arguably) the most dynamic and volatile asset class ever conceived.

The foreign currency exchange market is one of the most influential markets in the world today, the New York stock exchange, the Nasdaq and the Tokyo stock exchange the three largest securities markets in the world have a daily trading volume of around 300 billion USD combined… the foreign exchange market has a daily trading volume of around 6.6 trillion dollars per day according to the Bank for International Settlements (which is basically the central bank for central banks). This daily figure is more than the annual GDP of all but two of the largest nations on earth, China and the USA.

Well, in this video I want to explore three things: Why is the foreign exchange market so large and influential? Who actually conducts these trades and how? And while we are at it why is it that the UK pound is so valuable compared to all other currencies?

This is Andrew Yang: a tech entrepreneur and a bit of a surprise underdog democratic candidate for the U.S. presidency.

And while it's true that this channel avoids politics at all costs, EE is not politically advocating for (or against) Andrew Yang or any of the other candidates discussed between now and the 2020 election. And we'll not be looking at Yang as a candidate beyond his economic policies.

Switzerland, an extremely beautiful landlocked country in the heart of Europe, this picturesque nation is home to one of the most advanced economies in the world. When ignoring micronations like Monaco or Lichtenstein, Switzerland is one of only two countries in the world that has a nominal GDP above $80,000 USD per capita.

The Swiss are a little bit different though, other wealthy nations like Norway were typically blessed by a treasure trove of natural resources Switzerland did not have this. It was also lacking a lot of other key ingredients that contribute heavily to most successful countries, it did not have open access to an ocean for international trade, it did not have a particularly competitive cheap labor market, it did not have terrain that made building productive infrastructure particularly easy and it didn’t even have a population that could agree on what language to speak.

So what was its secret then, how did this nation obtain such tremendous wealth while seemingly been at such a huge disadvantage. In this video, we will attempt to find out by looking beyond just the simple facts and figures that make for strong economies.

This is Runescape: one of the oldest and most involved massively multiplayer online role-playing games in existence.

The game has been played by millions around the world but for those of you familiar to the channel you know we are not here for the gameplay or the mad early 2000’s style graphics, we are here for the economy.

And oh boy does Runescape have an amazing economy.

In this video, we'll explore the nuances of this economy and also look at an academic paper submitted by a channel viewer on this incredible virtual economy. Enjoy!

India is soon to be home to the largest population of citizens on the planet. And as of 2014, the nation will also hold the title of the fastest-growing major economy in the world (stealing the title from the slower-growing economy of China).

This country has had an amazing journey to get to where it is today. And with the right political governance, it's very likely to become one of the world's most powerful economies very soon. But, it's not quite there yet. And in GDP terms, India's collective economy is still smaller than that of California.

And while poverty is a very prevalent problem, India's certainly on the up and up. Throughout the past two decades, it has seen unbelievable levels of growth that has, among other things, pulled hundreds of millions of its citizens out of poverty.

North Korea, the most closed-off country on earth. This Asian nation is often the center of intense scrutiny for its aggressive displays of militarism, its internationally condemned nuclear program, and of course its oppressive government dictatorship. A 2014 report by the united nations concluded that the gravity, scale, and nature of these human rights violations does not have any parallel In the contemporary world. What they are ashamed of though, is something that all these media spectacles help to distract from and that is their incredibly small and pathetic economy.

Beyond the dramatic chest-beating and despite all of the opportunities this country has been given it has dwindled into complete economic obscurity and in this video we are going to explore why.

Monaco is the wealthiest nation in the world per capita. It's also the country with by far the highest average age of citizens. It has the highest cost of land of any country in the world, it pretty much breaks any kind of list you want to make ranking countries cause you can pretty much bet that this 2 square kilometer spit of land off the south of France is going to win any economic top ten list out there. 

So, what is really going on with the economy of Monaco?

Most people know it as a playground for the rich and famous, a parking garage for superyachts, a glorified formula 1 track, a country built around a casino, and above all else, a tax haven. But is this criticism really fair? ... let's explore in today's video!

Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) companies are big businesses around the world and they have rightfully attracted much criticism for questionable business practice. Many have called them illegal pyramid schemes, but today these companies continue to operate in most developed countries around the world and rake in billions of dollars in profit in any given year all with the blessing of local trade authorities.

So, what are these businesses? Let's park personal opinions on how annoying it is to be roped into one of these MLM meetings for the moment and assess the fundamental economics behind this business model.

Star Citizens' story has been that of bold ambition, record-breaking community support, and yes ... even a bit of good old-fashioned frustration.

In this video, we'll explore crowdfunding, the video game industry, and a project that may prove to be the greatest video game in history. Enjoy!

Additionally, we'll also check out a project so monolithic in its scale of player involvement that it surpasses any other project in video game history.

The Economic Explained team uses Statista for conducting our research. Check out their YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuj2Bne141HGmYFsbkfnbqw

Japan became the first of the modern Asian countries to experience massive sustained economic growth. Japan had a lot going for it after the end of the war, it was able to rebuild with the help of the allies and go through its own modern industrial revolution. In the 1960s, Japan was growing at a rate of 10% a year which for a national economy was unheard of at the time, this economic growth continued and japan was able to ride the wave of globalization as the world's low-cost manufacturer. Japan developed a huge car industry, it was at the forefront of consumer electronics and was working meticulously to make sure that this newfound wealth was being invested wisely into infrastructure like high-speed rail, airports and metro systems that would make their economy even more efficient. 

At its peak, there was so much wealth in japan that the real estate market of Tokyo had some pretty crazy anomalies. In the late 80’s it was estimated that the imperial palace covering an area of 3.4 square kilometers in central Tokyo had a real estate land value greater than all of the real estate in California. Of course, the imperial palace was never for sale and this was based on the cost per square feet in the area but it still should give a good idea of just how much money was washing around in Japan. 

In this video, we will look at how this all went so wrong and what it can tell us about countries that are today where japan was 40 years ago.

EVE Online has a botting problem. Robots can be programmed to play this game for hours at a time with no rest needed.

This has meant that normal players looking to play the game have been pushed to the side by these armies of robots that can farm currency far more effectively than they can. 

In this follow up video, we'll explore this issue and how it relates to the economy of the real world.

EVE Online is a massively multiplayer online game that is probably best known for articles about massive space battles with tens of thousands of players, or stories about in-game con men screwing over their allies after years of friendship. BUT! EVE online is interesting for a bigger reason though that is often overlooked, and that is its amazingly realistic economy. In this video, we explore one of the player nation-states and see how crazy realistic the economy of a video game about spaceships can be. 

This is not sponsored by the Imperium, EVE online, or its developer, CCP games (but they are more than welcome to send me a cheque!).

Bill Benter, is a reserved unassuming and media-shy Pittsburg resident who made almost 1 billion dollars by gambling on horse races.

The man was a mathematical genius who was on the cutting edge of both computer science and statistical modeling so it is widely assumed with his business knowledge that he could have made money just about anywhere, in a rare interview when asked about his success in horse racing he said: “I was driven only partly by money, I believe I probably could have made more money in finance, but that didn’t interest me, I didn’t get into professional horse racing because it was hard, but because it was said to be impossible”

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the world's poorest country, with a large majority of its 70 million citizens living in absolute poverty. For a long time, poverty in Africa has been seen as a purely humanitarian issue. But could the answer just be good economic management? Unfortunately, this is a situation with a very clear solution that is impossibly hard to attain.

Poverty is a tough issue to deal with, but in this video, we'll attempt to explore some of the fundamental causes of this poverty and see how they impact the Congo's fragile economy.

The automation economy is here and it's important to understand what our future will look like in a world where we may not have the ability to work in order to provide for ourselves.

We will look at what reputable economists have hypothesized our future to hold and the underlying economics behind these realities.
